# Alternative Controller for ITT Courier 110169

This firmware can be used to convert an ITT Courier 110169 keyboard to USB. 
It was written with the [Teensy 2.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html) microcontroller in mind,
because with it you only need to make minor modifications to the PCB.
This project makes use of the [tmk_core](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_core) keyboard firmware library.

## Wiring

The first thing you have to do is to desolder the original [8048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MCS-48) microcontroller.
Then you have to connect the Teensy to hole 9 - 32 on the PCB:

```
After that take a look at the bottom side of the PCB, where the microcontroller sits. Here you have to do a few things:
- Sever the connection between pin 10 and 26
- Bridge pins 8 and 9
- Connect pins 26 and 32
- Connect pins 27 and 35

It should look somewhat like this:
```
      Before:                           After:

```
Now you have to connect the Teensy to an USB cable. Theoretically you could directly connect a cable to the Teensy, but a cleaner way would be to repurpose the connector the original cable used and build a custom USB cable. For that you have to connect the Data - and Data + pins of the Teensy USB connector to pin 3 and 4 of the connector on the PCB:

```
  |  |  |  |  |  |
+-|--|--|--|--|--|-+
|                  |
+------------------+
 +5v  Data-  GND
    +5v  Data+  GND
```


## Build Instructions
Clone the repository with the following command:
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:DrCracket/itt-courier-110169-to-usb.git
```
See [tmk_core/doc/build.md](tmk_core/doc/build.md).

To build the firmware and program the controller run this command:
```sh
make teensy [KEYMAP=yourname]
```

You can select a keymap name with optional `KEYMAP=` ('plain' is the default name).

You can change keymap by editing code of `keymap_plain.c` directly, or copy it to your own keymap file like `keymap_yourname.c` and edit the file.
How to define the keymap is probably obvious. You can find key symbols in [tmk_core/doc/keycode.txt](tmk_core/doc/keycode.txt). See [tmk_core/doc/keymap.md](tmk_core/doc/keymap.md) for more detail.
